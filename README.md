This website allows you to search your food in the Open Food Facts Dataset (https://github.com/openfoodfacts). The website then averages all the products added once the user clicks done.

The cleaned data for this website can be found on google drive since it was too big for github (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZkZ3ToZ_RVtIr_b5b9Y9rYLU3PSYjl2E/view?usp=sharing).
